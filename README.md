## Overview
Some apps/ scripts that I found useful in making my Windows computer easier to use.

## Citation
I did try my best to cite the source, but I cannot guarantee that it is the original source.

## Security
Use in your own risk. Although I have all of them on my computer (and it is still fine), I cannot guarantee that they are 100% safe.
